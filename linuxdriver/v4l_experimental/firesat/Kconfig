	  Support for external IEEE1394 adapters designed by Digital Everywhere and
	  produced by El Gato, shipped under the brand name 'EyeTV 300/400'.

          These devices don't have a MPEG decoder built in, so you need
	  an external software decoder to watch TV.	  

	  Say Y if you own such a device and want to use it.
