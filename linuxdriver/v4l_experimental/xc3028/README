== Hauppauge HVR 900 ==

==== Installation ====

1. get the v4l-dvb repository from linuxtv and type make for generating all symlinks in v4l-dvb/v4l
2. copy tuner.h into v4l-dvb/linux/include/media/ in your v4l directory
3. simply replace following files in the repository  
 * Makefile
 * em28xx-cards.c  
 * em28xx.h  
 * tuner-core.c  
 * tuner-types.c  
 * xc3028.c 
with the files in this directory and simply recompile (copy these files to v4l-dvb/v4l)

==== Firmware ====

this device needs a firmware, which is stored in emBDA.sys
build the firmwareextractor with
$ gcc convert.c -o convert
and extract the firmware
$ ./convert emBDA.sys > /lib/firmware/xceive_xc_3028.fw
(I only tested that tool with Hauppauge HVR 900, Terratec might work too but without any guarantee - please send me BDA files of other xc3028 devices)

==== General ====

 * the xc3028 works very reliable and the frequencies are correct for europe
 * Please add your email, product name, vendor/product id to the discussion in the v4l wiki at www.linuxtv.org
 * I'll not be responsible for any damage caused by this driver, use it with your own risk
 
==== TODO ====

 * some cleanup
 * figuring out channel locks
